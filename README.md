# Hi! I'm Mikhail. Python developer.

### I develop parsing scripts and WebApps for them, telegram bots, websites on Django, also I deploy projects on servers and set up CI/CD.

#### Right now I'm working on improving my pet-project <a href="https://assetsloop.com/">Assets Loops</a>. This is a service for parsing cryptocurrency rates and scoring the most profitable combinations. (I can share the repository on request)
